# 23w13a_or_b_moon_mode

A Minecraft datapack for Snapshot 23w13a_or_b (the 2023 April fools snapshot) which enables "moon mode", which introduces the following changes.

## Rules

The following rules are automatically approved in moon mode.

 1. air_blocks
 2. big_head_mode
 3. fish_anything
 4. instacheese
 5. pickaxe_block

In addition, voting for new rules is disabled by setting the following rules.

 1. new_vote_chance_per_tick (1/999999999)
 2. quorum_percent (101%)
 3. votes_to_win_percent (101%)

## Random Tick Speed

The random tick speed is increased by 10x, making it easier to grow crops on the moon.

## Disable the Overworld

The overworld is disabled in moon mode. Players automatically spawn on on the moon.

## Enable Lunar Nether Portals

Nether portals can be lit on the moon. These must be 5 x 4 blocks - portals of different sizes cannot be lit due to limiations of the datapack.

Nether portals will take you to the nether when entering them from the moon. When entering them from the nether, players will return to the moon.
